## Rextester

## LoopPerfect C++ Fiddle

URL: http://fiddle.jyt.io/

Claims to be an interactive C++ interpreter/terminal but seems to be broken, or the interface is so non.obvious that is should be considered broken.

C++ compilers: unknown

## Codepad

URL: http://codepad.org/

Can be unintuitive - pasting new code while at an existing URL will return to the original code.
Does not provide means to add runtime input or change the compiler flags (used flags are documented on the "about" page).

C++ compilers: GCC 4.1.2 -> C++03

## Visual C++ Compiler Online

URL: http://webcompiler.cloudapp.net/

Single file compilation, reduced set of compiler flags, command line arguments for executable possible, no runtime input. Running the executable after compilation is optional.

C++ compilers: MSVC 19.10 (x86) aka VS 2017 -> C++14

## Tutorialspoint CodingGround

URL: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cpp11_online.php

An online IDE with multiple files. Runtime input and compiler flags available, but no command line arguments. The whole application seems to be sluggish at times, I could not register to try out the features that require an account login like saving or uploading whole projects (broken link/unresponsive webapp). 

C++ compilers: GCC 4.8.5 -> C++11

## C++ Shell

URL: http://cpp.sh/

Single file compilation, reduced set of compiler flags, runtime input static or interactive, but no command line arguments. 
The web application seems to hang sometimes during compilation or execution. 

C++ compilers: GCC 4.9.2 -> C++11, partially C++14
